This guide provides a quick start for running different profiles of PrivateGPT using Docker Compose.
The profiles cater to various environments, including Ollama setups (CPU, CUDA, MacOS) and fully Local setup.

If you want to run PrivateGPT locally without Docker, refer to the [Local Installation Guide](/installation).

#### Prerequisites
- **Docker and Docker Compose:** Ensure both are installed on your system.
[Installation Guide for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Installation Guide for Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- **Clone PrivateGPT Repository:** Clone the PrivateGPT repository to your machine and navigate to the directory:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt.git
  cd private-gpt
  ```

## Ollama Setups (Recommended)

Ollama setups are recommended for their ease of use and optimized configurations. Ollama offers different profiles depending on your hardware capabilities and operating system.

### 1. Default/Ollama CPU

**Description:**
This profile runs the Ollama service using CPU resources. It is the standard configuration for running Ollama-based Private-GPT services without GPU acceleration.

**Run:**
To start the services, use either of the following commands:
```sh
docker-compose up
```
or
```sh
docker-compose --profile ollama up
```

### 2. Ollama Nvidia CUDA

**Description:**
This profile leverages GPU acceleration with CUDA support, suitable for computationally intensive tasks that benefit from GPU resources.

**Requirements:**
- Ensure that your system has compatible GPU hardware and the necessary NVIDIA drivers installed. The installation process is detailed [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html).

**Run:**
To start the services with CUDA support, use:
```sh
docker-compose --profile ollama-cuda up
```

### 3. Ollama Host

**Description:**
This profile is designed for running PrivateGPT using Ollama installed on the host machine. This setup is particularly useful for MacOS users, as Docker does not yet support Metal GPU.

**Requirements:**
- Install Ollama on your machine by following the instructions at [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/).
- Start the Ollama service with the command:
```sh
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve
```

**Run:**
To start the services with the host configuration, use:
```sh
docker-compose --profile ollama-host up
```

## Fully Local Setups

### LlamaCPP + HuggingFace Embeddings

**Description:**
This profile runs the Private-GPT services locally using `llama-cpp` and Hugging Face models.

**Requirements:**
- **Hugging Face Token (HF_TOKEN):** Required for accessing Hugging Face models. Obtain your token following [this guide](/installation/getting-started/troubleshooting#downloading-gated-and-private-models).

**Run:**
Start the services with your Hugging Face token:
```sh
HF_TOKEN=<your_hf_token> docker-compose up --profile local
```
Replace `<your_hf_token>` with your actual Hugging Face token.
